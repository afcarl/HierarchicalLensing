DIAGNOSTIC(S) FROM PARSER:
Warning (non-fatal):
Left-hand side of sampling statement (~) may contain a non-linear transform of a parameter or local variable.
If so, you need to call increment_log_prob() with the log absolute determinant of the Jacobian of the transform.
Left-hand-side of sampling statement:
    log_cl_params[i] ~ multi_normal_cholesky(...)
